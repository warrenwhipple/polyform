 Notes and Ideas on Modes
--------------------------

* Tall tower
  Build a tall tower.
  (like 99 bricks)

* Phase shift:
  Add a control that allows block to pass through others while held.
  (like perfect balance)
  
* Gravity planet:
  Blocks fall into a center gravity field.
  
* Rescue:
  Build a tower up to an object.
  Then destroy parts of the tower to get the object down.
  Optional that object is fragile.
  (like totem destroyer and topple)
  
* Destruction:
  Bubbles of acid or bomb fall onto tower and destroy bricks.
  What is the goal?
  
* Acid rain:
  Acid occasionally falls from the sky destroying bricks.
  Certain bricks are immune.
  Could have different immunity types.
  (like cover orange)
  
* Slippery block:
  Base starts with some variation of 45 degree surfaces.
  Blocks are very slippery.
  (like 45 degree tetris)
  
* Row destruction:
  Laser scans over tower and destroys block in a row.
  Blocks must have a relatively small velocity.
  Laser can have a thickness.
  Blocks must be destructible.
  (like tetris & nottetris 2)
  
* Low tower:
  Keep a tower below a certain level.
  This level could rise as the game continues.
  (like 99 bricks)
  
* Sideways:
  Get your tower to build sideways a certain amount.
  
* Glue bricks:
  Certain bricks glue together when they touch.
  One contact becomes a joint.
  Two contacts become one body.
  
* Glue/Acid/Mercury  bubble:
  Splashes on some bricks.
  
* Glue/Acid/Mercury syringe.
  Injects a single brick.
  
* Magnet bricks:
  Certain brick are attracted to each other;
  
* Glass bricks:
  Certain bricks break under weight.
  
* No rotation mode:

* No slide mode:
  
* Twin:
  Control 2 blocks simultaneously.
  
* Full drop:
  Drop blocks from very top.
